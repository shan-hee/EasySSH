# Contributing Guide (EN)

Please refer to the repository root `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full guide. TL;DR:

- Environment: Node >= 20; prefer pnpm (workspace enabled)
- Code style: ESLint + Prettier; run `pnpm lint:fix` and `pnpm format` before commit
- TypeScript: both frontend and server; run `pnpm typecheck` for FE
- Branch names: feat/, fix/, docs/, chore/
- Pull Requests: describe motivation/scope/impact; update docs if behavior or APIs change
